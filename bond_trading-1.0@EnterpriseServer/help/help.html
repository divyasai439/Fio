SCENARIO:
--------
      This demo demonstrates a typical Bond Trading scenario wherein messages
are exchanged at a very fast rate between various parties.

      The prices of the bonds change at a fast rate. Buyers keep track of the
price and based on the current price can request for a quote from a trading
center. Based on the availability of the Bond at the requested price, the 
center can send an appropriate response to the buyer.

      In this demo, there are three financial centers viz. London, Singapore,
Boston. They publish their Bonds identitified by unique ISINs. The Bond 
details appear on GUIs for users to keep track of the changing prices. The 
GUI allows user to buy a bond, by specifying the quantity and asking price. 
Based on the ISIN, the request is routed to the appropriate center.
