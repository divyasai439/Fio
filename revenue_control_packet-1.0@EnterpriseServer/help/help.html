SCENARIO:
--------
      This demo is a scaled down version of a real life implementation at a customer 
site. It represents a very typical situation in a production support environment where 
the data in different systems needs to be synchronized. The data modification communication 
between the systems involved is in the orm of proprietary flat files. The application 
also shows how a business scenario can be built using the Fiorano Studio,
 by simply dragging and dropping various coarse grained components (or 
Fiorano Components) and orchestrating an event process based on the current business 
needs.

Orchestrating this application / event process involves the following steps.

1. A particular directory is being monitored for files of type *.LDF.
2. The contents of these files are in proprietary format. So a custom component is 
   used to
     a) extract the content of these files,
     b) convert the extracted flat- file data into its corresponding XML,
     c) then use the same to update a back-end database.
3. Errors occurring in any of the intermediate steps are
     a) displayed,
     b) written to a file,
     c) communicated via e-mail to a particular user.

      To provide a seamless real-time transformation of the business documents flowing 
through the composed Fiorano Network, Fiorano SOA Platform provides the XSLT 
component. This Fiorano component converts the incoming business documents to an 
outgoing format as per its configurations done at the time the event process was 
composed. It uses the Fiorano Mapper Tool to configure mapping details between the 
input and the output structures and utilizes the standard XSLT Engine to perform the 
required transformations.

PRELIMINARY STEPS:
-----------------
1. Start the HSQL database server by executing this batch file: starthsql.bat 
   located in %FIORANO_HOME%\esb\samples\hsql.
2. Also run the batch file init.bat from %FIORANO_HOME%\esb\samples\EventProcesses\
   RevenueControlPacket\resources.
   
RUNNING THE EVENT PROCESS:
-------------------------
1. Run the batch file : RevenueControlPacket_Install.bat located in %FIORANO_HOME%\
   esb\samples\EventProcesses\RevenueControlPacket\resources.
2. View the Display windows that will open automatically. Once the processing is 
   complete, an appropriate message will appear in at least one of the Display windows.
3. Once you are done with the demo, kindly run the batch file cleanup.bat from 
   %FIORANO_HOME%\esb\samples\EventProcesses\RevenueControlPacket\resources.
