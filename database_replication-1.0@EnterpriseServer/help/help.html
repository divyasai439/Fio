SCENARIO:
--------
      The Database Replication Demo demonstrates the usage of DBAdapter for database 
replication.
      The event process consists of a CRM service instance, using which PO is generated. 
This PO is fed into the OracleIn instance of the DBAdapter. The OracleOut writes the PO 
into the "PurchaseOrders" table in the Oracle Database.
      The OracleOut instance of the DBAdapter, which is monitoring table "PurchaseOrders"
for insert operations, gets these records, converts it into XML and passes it on to the 
SqlServerIn instance of the DBAdapter. The SqlServerIn inserts into the "PurchaseOrders" 
table in the connected SQL Server database. 

PRELIMINARY STEPS:
-----------------
1. If you haven't run the script file: orcl.bat (windows) or orcl.sh (*nix) located in %FIORANO_HOME%/esb/samples
   /EventProcesses/DatabaseReplication/resources. This batch or script file creates a schema named
   tifositest and a table named purchaseorders in the Oracle Database that you will use 
   to run this event process. In case you have already run this batch file and created 
   the schema and table on the database, you can skip this step.
2. If you haven't run the script file: mssql.bat (windows) or mssql.sh (*nix) located in %FIORANO_HOME%/esb/samples
   /EventProcesses/DatabaseReplication/resources. This batch or script file creates a schema named
   TifosiTest and a table named purchaseorders in the MSSQL Database that you will use 
   to run this event process. In case you have already run this batch file and created 
   the schema and table on the database, you can skip this step.
3. Double click on OracleIn Service. This will open its CPS. Edit the JDBC URL to 
   jdbc:oracle:thin:@<your database location>:<your database port>:<your database name>. 
   For example, a typical JDBC URL would look like: jdbc:oracle:thin:@164.164.128.115:1521:orcl. 
   Leave rest of the settings as is. Press the Finish button to save your settings.
4. Do the same for OracleOut Service.
5. Double click on SQLServerIn Service. This will open its CPS. Edit the JDBC URL to
   jdbc:odbc:Driver={SQL Server};Server=<your database location>;Database=<your database 
   name>;Uid=TifosiTest;Pwd=TifosiTest;. For example a typical JDBC URL would look 
   like: jdbc:odbc:Driver={SQL Server};Server=164.164.128.115;Database=master;Uid=sa;Pwd=;. 
   Leave rest of the settings as is. Press the Finish button to save your settings.

RUNNING THE EVENT PROCESS:
-------------------------
1. Send a PO from the CRM Service.
2. This will add a record in the database configured in OracleIn service.
3. In addition, a similar record will be entered in the database configured in 
   SQLServerIn Service.
